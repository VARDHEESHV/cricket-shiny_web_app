JigglingBot,Shashank the most relieved man in the stadium because that's absolutely shockingly casual running in the biggest game of your career.,1205,2025-06-01T20:18:27Z,1

Chemical-Rub-5206,"Bro literally i was watching w my mom and she went ""oh that's out"" and I was concerned for a second. I was like is ur vision getting worse? R u not alert? Then during the replay it turned out this man was casually out by a fucking foot and a half. I started wondering if really I was the crazy one for expecting more of a reaction, either from MI, Shashank, or the spectators. The strangest runout I've seen in recent history tbh. Fever dream ass wicket",128,2025-06-01T20:40:14Z,4

whyamihere999,"I knew that ot was out, right at the moment the ball hit the Stumps.. just watched the replays to confirm it. Forget that.. Remember the run out that ended Raina's 87(25) in IPL playoffs??? We were watching it live in the stadium, top tear of Garware Pavillion just 4th or 5th row from the top, and I told my friends that it's out while they were saying it was not out and some of them were not sure. They kept telling me that it's too close to call. I was like, bro, it's not even close, it's clearly out! Replays showed Raina was just couple of inches short. I was amazed at myself how I could see the couple of inches gap from such a height. P.S. I've played a good level of cricket. Played against some international India players, have played alongwith some Mumbai Ranji players. So maybe that has had effect on my vision and decision-making.",1,2025-06-02T10:35:45Z,8

Fallen_Man7,I don't think field placements would've mattered much. But the main thing is bowling changes.

Chemical-Rub-5206,"Exactly. After Bumrah and SKY, he's been MI's 3rd best player this season. 5 wicket haul, plenty of good knocks with the bat. That runout today was clean too. The hate really does feel forced. I wouldn't mind another captain - SKY or bumrah - stepping in. But Hardik was inarguably a beast as an all rounder this season. Also did people not see the fucking form Shreyas Iyer was in? I'm pretty sure you could merge every other ipl captain into one, it would not make any difference. That man was not going to be stopped today.",35,2025-06-01T20:42:25Z,83
Raken_dep,"Santner was containing the run rate in his overs Shreyas Iyer was taking all the pacers to the cleaners by utilising whatever pace they were offering to his advantage It was literal writing on the wall there for Hardik to use the strength of Santner (containing the RR) while also taking away the strength (the momentum Iyer had gathered against pace) of Shreyas Iyer today by utilising at least one more over of Santner if not both. Granted Shreyas is a good player of spin, but Santner bowls really tight and Iyer would really have to earn those runs against Mitch. Momentum is a thing in sports. It was Santner that brought the turning point of our season by taking the wicket of Karun, who, like Iyer, looked as though he was going to take Delhi towards the win. If Santner had given away even 12 runs per over, it would still have made a massive difference and put a lot of pressure on PBKS in the death overs. And the final nail in the coffin was Hardik not stepping up for the 19th over himself but instead handing the ball to a highly inexperienced and young player in a game like this. The MI management really shot themselves in the foot with this whole Hardik captaincy call. Even Hardik did himself a disservice by not choosing to continue with GT where he was doing well both as a captain and as a player.",22,2025-06-01T22:52:49Z,84
unnervinglynervous,Not bowling Santner and bowling Ashwani at a very stressful moment is a decision I will continue to be baffled by. Does everyone in the IPL hate Santner or something?,6,2025-06-02T04:51:51Z,85

MadDongla,"Over reliance on Bumrah It's funny. Even though we won a lot , this season reminded me a lot of 2022 whenever we lost. We never really had a proper bowling attack. Most of boults wickets came in the death overs, not the pp. Santner has finished his 4 overs..uh, once, I think. Hardik is too scared to bowl himself anymore. Worst part is , there isn't much to fix here. We've got good domestic bowlers , a good spinner , great batting. Good overseas bowlers and batters. This team should've been at number 1.

shyboy_c_u,Another interesting thing is Delhi also had a 100 percent 200 defending record earlier this year and they lost that in Ahmedabad. Mumbai’s 200 record also gets broken here. Plus Mumbai so far has never won a game in Ahmedabad. If Ambanis had real power as the memes suggest they would have ensured the playoffs happened in the original venues as MI has a great record there.,11,2025-06-01T20:29:55Z,151
the_HR,"I mean what the fuck is the captaincy from Pandya?! Why the fuck was Santner given only 2 overs in a surface where the ball was holding up? Santner was always being under utilised but today? What the fuck was even the bowling rotation today? Why was Santner not given the ball instead of Topley? That was such a common sense decision but I think common sense is not so common. Santner had just given 15 from his two and this was a pitch which was tailor made for Santner. I'm just fucking devestated right now. Also, 15 off 12 with the bat. We were 15-20 runs short. Why was he batting like we've already gotten enough? Maybe I'm being reactionary but fuck this man, this was a game we should've won.",27,2025-06-01T20:32:40Z,152
OptimumWaste,Agreed with all of the points. Hardik is very cocky and over confident. Played like we had already won the match. Didn't even realise the ball was holding up and they had to bowl short and slow. He fucks it up again. Ashwani has no experience but he just kept feeding Iyer. Absolutely shocking from the whole MI team. Malinga and pollard should be shown the door lol wtf are they even there for. I mean I have never played even school cricket but I could see the ball was holding up. But all these stalwarts were just high on coke or something. I just hope Hardik is taken off captaincy now and vadapav shown the door.,16,2025-06-01T20:41:37Z,153

varunpigeon55,"I think today’s game was lost due to Hardik’s captaincy. So many blunders in the second innings. - Not using Santner when he was clearly the bowler who was containing the opposition. More so when PBSK for scoring freely against pace bowling. - Setting up the game to bowl the last over - Glory Hunter. Hardik was clearly one of the better bowlers. He should have bowled the 17th or 19th over. I guess he wanted the glory if MI did end up containing PBSK. I am not saying this because Mumbai lost or trying to hate on Hardik, but it’s clearly a pattern with his game. He doesn’t read the game in critical moments and always has to depend on individual brilliance from someone to rescue him out. I’m sure he will improve but it is important to step back and put the team forward.",10,2025-06-01T23:33:26Z,155
OptimumWaste,"Not only is he short on ideas but also unjustifiably cocky and over-confident. He was batting like there was no urgency. Scored 14 off 15 I think and all the pressure shifted on Dheer, who was fantastic. He should always play ahead of Pandya. While bowling, the decisons he took were stupid as fuck. All the bowlers, including Bumrah kept bowling full and no change of pace when the pitch was clearly holding up if you bowl short. PBKS used it brilliantly and restricted MI to 200. Never backed himself as a bowler, even though he was bowling well or Santner, who was criminally under-bowled throughout the IPL. It also seems he doesn't command respect or communication from other players.",2,2025-06-02T10:19:00Z,156

organised-choas,"Serious blunders by Hardik at multiple points in the match : - Santer should have bowled atleast 3 if not 4 overs. He's a top quality international spinner, and if he's not bowling his full quota, that's criminal. Chahal bowled his full quota of 4 overs; and Santer didn't after giving away just 15 runs in 2 overs. Shame! - Hardik himself should have bowled more. Putting the onus on Topley and Ashwani just shows the lack of character and leadership of Hardik. Shame! - Rohit could trust Hardik with the 2 off the last 4 overs in a T20 World Cup Final, but Hardik couldn't trust himself. Shame! - Serves the MI management right for sticking with Hardik as captain after last year's debacle. After this year, there should be no more doubt that Hardik is not captaincy material. Making players like Rohit, Sky and Bumrah play under a jerk like Hardik. Shame! - Now I'm fully backing PBKS and Shreyas to lift the title. ICT needs Shreyas at the helm atleast in white ball cricket. I'm hoping that winning back to back IPL titles will finally give Shreyas his due and get him the long-deserved white-ball captaincy. - Have been a lifelong MI fan. But I'm no more supporting MI until Hardik is removed as captain. If Ro is in the team, he's gotta be the captain. If not Ro, then SKY. But no HP for sure.",23,2025-06-01T20:32:16Z,161

Mi didn't seem to have much of a bowling plan other than give the ball to bumrah and pray lol. Punjab bowlers bowled mainly short length balls which gave them success Mi on the other hand did the complete opposite and went mainly for fuller length balls. Don't know why Santner also only bowled 2 overs 😵‍💫. Shreyas Iyer played one of the best knockout match innings in the ipl 🫡.
