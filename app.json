which provides opportunities to two or more players working together towards a shared objective is called a team game. A team game is an activity in which individuals are organised in a team to compete with the opposing team, in accordance with a set of laws/rules to win. Games like Basketball, Cricket, Football, Handball, Hockey, Volleyball, etc., are some of the classic examples of major team games. However, over a period of time, the popularity of team games has grown continuously. These games have positively influenced not just the players, but also their fans, local and national economies. All over the world, the impact of team games can be seen resulting in professional players to live out their dreams. Star players have become role models to youth. Young athletes/players develop life skills which are followed as footsteps of their role models. In this chapter, some of the team games like Basketball, Cricket, Football, Handball, Hockey, Kabaddi, Kho-Kho, and Volleyball are explained. Basketball Basketball is a team game played between two teams of five players each, on the court. Very high amount of energy (calories) expenditure is there in this game. It also helps in building bone and muscle strength and boosts the immune system. This game also develops self-discipline and concentration among young players. History Basketball originated in the United States of America and was invented by Dr. James Naismith in December, 1891, who was a Physical Educator at the International Young Men’s Christian Association Training School (YMCA) (now known Reprint 2025-26 Chap-5.indd 129 31-07-2020 15:27:24 130 Health and Physical Education - XI as Springfield College of Physical Education) in Springfield, Massachusetts. Do You Know? On January 15 1892, the first set of rules of the Basketball game were published by Dr. James Naismith in the college magazine, “Triangle”, under the title “A New Game”. Fig. 5.1: Dr. James Naismith Naismith sought a vigorous indoor game to keep his students occupied and at proper levels of fitness. But after rejecting many ideas, he obtained a soccer ball and two wooden peach baskets. He hung the baskets on the railing of the balcony at the height of 10 ft above the floor at the opposite ends of the gym hall. The objective of the game was to toss the soccer ball into the peach baskets. The first basketball game was played among physical education students with nine players on each side, of Springfield secretarial training class of Physical Education (PE) College in December, 1891. The International Basketball Federation FIBA (French acronym: Federation Internationale de Basketball) association was founded in Geneva in 1932. Basketball was featured in the St. Louis, Missouri, United States, III Olympic Games in 1904. It was officially recognised as an Olympic game in 1936 in Berlin. Due to the wide popularity, Basketball was played in the first Asian Games in 1951 held at New Delhi. History of basketball in India Basketball was introduced in India by American missionaries towards the end of the first decade of 20th century. It was presumed that in the year 1905, the game of basketball was started at the YMCA Calcutta by H. Peterson and J.N. Guaj. The credit of starting and popularising this game goes to YMCA College of Physical Education, Madras in the year 1920. The first National Basketball Championship was organised in 1934 by the Indian Olympic Association and later after the Reprint 2025-26 Chap-5.indd 130 31-07-2020 15:27:24 Team Games 131 constitution of Basketball Federation of India (BFI) in 1950 at Do You Know?

Basic Skills of Basketball Basketball is played with the help of different skills and techniques like stance, footwork, ball holding and handling, dribbling, passing-receiving, shooting and rebounding. Few are mentioned here. Dribbling It is important to move the ball across the court, get away from defensive players, make or find a good passing line, make use of faking action, 1 on 1 and of course to penetrate the ball to score the goal. There are different types of dribbling which may be learnt and developed with the help of different drills in stationary and moving positions with or without the defensive player.

It helps to speed the ball, find an open man, to find a good shooter or to get away the ball from the defender. Fake and feint are used to increase the quality of passing. There are different types of passing using one or both hands during different stationary and moving group and team drills. •• Chest pass •• Overhead pass •• Push pass •• Bounce pass •• Shoulder pass •• Hook pass •• Off the dribble pass •• Baseball pass Fig. 5.10: Passing and receiving Shooting The objective of the game is to win by scoring maximum points. Therefore, improving the team’s shooting is important to win a game. Shooting by either one or both hands may be done in the following ways: •• Jump Shot •• Dunk Shot •• Free Throw •• Layup •• Three point shot Reprint 2025-26 Chap-5.indd 139 31-07-2020 15:27:27 140 Health and Physical Education - XI Fig. 5.11: Shooting Rebounding The objective of rebounding is to successfully gain possession of the basketball after a missed field goal or free throw, as it rebounds from the ring or backboard. This plays a major role in the game, as most possessions end when a team misses a shot. There are two categories of rebound—offensive rebound, in which the ball is recovered by the offensive side and does not change possession, and defensive rebound, in which the defending team gains possession of the loose ball. The majority of rebound is defensive, as the team on defence tend to be better positioned to recover the missed shots. Fig. 5.12: Rebounding Defence The game of basketball allows a variety of defences to be deployed in an effort to disrupt and combat the offensive plays. Here are examples of the three basic categories of team defence. In addition, each category consists of an assortment of different variations.

Combination defences are usually deployed in an effort to stop or neutralise great individual offensive players. Awards in Basketball To motivate the extraordinary achievements of the player and coaches, the Government of India honours players with different awards along with cash prizes and certificates.

Cricket also, through the constant running across the field, helps in increasing the stamina, balance, hand-eye coordination, flexibility and ball-handling skills. Cricket includes a lot of throwing and sprinting across the field, which is a good cardiovascular activity. History A reference of a game resembling to cricket is there in the records of King Edward I, in 1300 being played at Kent. Cricket as a game was first recorded in 16th century in England. Researches show that the game evolved from a very old, widespread game to pass time in which one player served a small piece like a ball made up of wood or any other material and another player hit it with a suitable item. The first recorded cricket match took place in Kent in 1646. Cricket was popular and widely documented in England during the 1700s. After 1760, the game saw the evolution of over arm bowling by replacing under arm bowling. The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) was formed on 31st May, 1787. After a year, it laid down a code of laws regarding the game. Its laws were adopted throughout the game. MCC today remains the custodian and arbiter of laws relating to cricket around the world. Thereafter, cricket recognisably became the game that is played today. In the 1800, cricket had reached the West Indies and India and in the 19th century cricket was played in South Africa and New Zealand. The first international cricket game was played between the USA and Canada in 1844. The match was played at the grounds of St George’s Cricket Club in New York. In 1877, an England touring team in Australia played two matches against full Australian XIs that are now regarded as the inaugural test matches. History of Cricket in India Cricket is undoubtedly one of the most popular games in India since its inception. The first Indian Cricket club, named the Parsee Oriental Cricket Club, was founded in the year 1848 and they played their first match in Bombay (Mumbai). From this point, the journey of Indian cricket began. The first international exposure in the history of Indian Cricket came in the year 1926. In the same year, a team from the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) toured India. Though it was an unofficial tour, Indian people were quite interested and enthusiastic about the matches that MCC played during the tour.

Fig. 5.14: Cricket in the early ages Functional Rules Cricket has many laws, more than any other game. Cricket is played with a bat and ball on a large field, known as ground. It is played between two teams having 11 players each. There is also a reserved player called a ‘twelfth player’, who is used if any player is injured during the play. The twelfth player is not allowed to bowl, bat, or to act as wicketkeeper or captain of the team. The twelfth player is only to act as a substitute fielder. The objective of the game is to score runs with the bat by the batsman, or dismiss the opposing batsman when in the field by the bowlers. The cricket laws are for the traditional form of cricket which is called ‘Test Cricket’. However, there are separate rules for one day and T20 format game also.

Their role is to ensure in the ground that the game is played as per the preambles and laws. The third umpire is in charge of the video decisions. Game Structure: Test cricket is a game that spans for two or more innings. This means that one team needs to bowl and the other would do batting. If a team is out twice or scores less runs in two innings, than that team is the losing team. Before the game begins, an umpire tosses a coin. The captain who guesses the correct side of the coin will then choose whether to bat or field first. How to play Cricket •• One team will bat while the other team will field. •• If the bowler bowls the ball from the wrong place or the ball is either dangerous or bounces more than twice or rolls before reaching the batsman or if fielders are standing at illegal positions, it is called ‘No Ball’.

Today, football is world’s most favourite sport played in almost every country. Studies reveal about various games similar to the modern football being introduced in different parts of the world by different cultures for different purposes. Oldest version of football game is believed to be played in the villages of Chinese dynasty. History of the Game Both rugby and football have a common root. There were many who instead of kicking believed in running with the ball in their hands. Kicking the ball included tripping the legs without any legislation or rules to govern. On the contrary, many people stood for football with kicking as it involved greater mastery of ball. In football, high level of skill precision was required to control and manoeuvre the ball with foot. The rules of play were subsequently smoothed down and smartened to create organised sports at Britain and Scotland. It was at this point that the people spoke out against rough customs as tripping, shin-kicking and so on. As it happened, the majority also expressed disapproval at carrying the ball with hand. It was in 1863 in England that the Rugby football group withdrew and formed a separate branch. This further led to the development modern-day sports of ‘Association Football’, ‘Rugby Football’ and ‘Gaelic Football’ in Ireland. Later the Football Association in England was formed becoming the sports’ first governing body. In 1904, ‘Federation International de Football Association’ (FIFA) was founded in Paris as an international governing body of football. The game of football in today’s scenario is called ‘Soccer’.

In the year 1888, ‘Durand Cup’ was started in Shimla (India) and in modern time Durand cup for football is regarded as second oldest football tournament in the world. Later in 1904, FIFA (Federation International de Football Association) was formed with France, Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, Spain and Germany as the founder members. History of Football in India Football in India has been a popular sport introduced in nineteenth century by the British army, from the capital at Calcutta. Durand Cup started in 1888, founded by the then India’s Foreign Secretary, Mortimer Durand at Shimla. Durand Cup is the third oldest football tournament after Football Association (FA) Cup and Scottish Cup. Clubs like Mohan Bagan, which is the oldest current team, was formed in 1889. Indian Football Association (IFA) Shield is the fourth oldest tournament in the world which was founded in 1893 and is still being played. Durand Cup was shifted to Delhi. Since 1950, every year it is organised under the supervision of Indian Army.

SPORTS DEVELOPMENT AND YOUTH ENGAGEMENT FICCI - IISM KNOWLEDGE REPORT SPORTS DEVELOPMENT AND YOUTH ENGAGEMENT 1 2 SPORTS DEVELOPMENT AND YOUTH ENGAGEMENT Foreword The potential for Sports to expand in terms of development as well as popularity in the existing Indian market is nothing short of tremendous. It would not be inaccurate to say that we are currently witnessing a revolution of sports, as far as the packaging and marketing of multiple sports is concerned. Cricket apart, sporting events and properties like the Pro Kabaddi League and the Indian Super League, to name just two, have found enthusiastic support, not only from sports-lovers, but also international and local sponsors. The evolution of the economy has ensured a rise in the disposable income of households and consequently, an increase in spending on activities that were perceived as ‘unconventional’ not very long ago. Sports constitute one such activity. The passion of the Indian sports-lover for multiple sports is being reflected in the television ratings, which are looking more and more impressive with every passing day, match and tournament. FICCI believes that the ‘sporting revolution’ can be accelerated even further. There are numerous investment and growth opportunities in the sports sector, some of which are being utilised. However, there are many more that can be identified and tapped. FICCI has been organizing the “TURF” Global Sports Summit every year since 2009, to facilitate precisely this objective. “TURF” is our annual flagship event and India’s largest International Convention on the Business of Sports. It is a strategic dialogue platform to bring together senior decision makers and the who’s who of Indian and International Sports industry to deliberate on sports as a career and a business and wellness opportunity. The ultimate aim is to take India closer to becoming a ‘sporting’ nation, with the youth at the forefront, both on and off the playing arenas. Mr. Dilip Chenoy Secretary General FICCI SPORTS DEVELOPMENT AND YOUTH ENGAGEMENT 3 4 SPORTS DEVELOPMENT AND YOUTH ENGAGEMENT Message from IISM Director The sports industry is witnessing an upward surge. The advent of multiple sporting leagues & increased fan participation has made the sports sector a powerhouse of unexplored avenues & innumerable opportunities. The involvement of youth right from the grassroots level will ensure that the Sports Industry continues to grow. International Institute of Sports Management (IISM), which pioneered sports management education in India, IISM presently offers Bachelors and Masters programmes in association with Mumbai University as well as an autonomous Post Graduate Program in Sports and Wellness Management. IISM equips students with the professional skills and proficiency necessary to have meaningful careers within the sports industry & be a driving force behind its success. We may focus on engaging youth in different capacities. However, the questions remain the same - “Is the youth industry ready? Do they have the required skills? How are they being helped to acquire those skills? We believe in constantly adapting to the industry’s needs. The environment at IISM instils the spirit of initiative, ingenuity and courage in each student along with imparting classroom education and field experience side by side. Our culture facilitates not just learning from academicians and eminent industry captains but peer learning as well. Aided by the latest technology, a continually evolving curriculum, and constant corporate interaction, we wish to transform the youth from being first class management students into astute thought leaders who are ready to take on the challenges of the sports corporate world, both in India and abroad. Our endeavour is to become a ‘movement’ that creates professionals who have the ability and agility to create landmarks and set benchmarks in the sports sector and the business that surrounds it. Our endeavour to empower young professionals to pursue their dream careers amplifies & encourages us to keep moving upward & onward.

Cricket and cricketers reigned supreme. However, things are changing. While cricket remains popular, other sports are also making an impression. A nation that did not produce a single individual medalist at the Olympics from 1956 to 1992 has made its presence felt on podiums of global sporting events in the recent past. From being cynical about the prospects of our athletes, we as a nation have started expecting them to perform and excel. This is a monumental change. More youngsters are playing and following multiple sports. The number of professionals in the sector, all of whom are essaying critical roles on and off the arenas, continues to grow. These are individuals who live and breathe sport, and will do anything they can to take India to unprecedented heights in the field of sport, provided they get the right kind of support at the right time. However, there is still a long way to go. Youth engagement and grassroots development remain challenges.

Sports as Reliable Career Yes No 10% 90% 90% youth feel that Sports is a reliable career-option. 14 SPORTS DEVELOPMENT AND YOUTH ENGAGEMENT We have seen that a significant percentage of Indian youth is interested in Sports. They even consider it a reliable career-option. However, the active participation of this ‘interested’ pool is negligible. Parental support is one of the most crucial factors determining careers of the youth in India. By and large, parents are not all that inclined to look at careers in sports in favorable terms.

Youngsters appear not to be enthused with other options like Organizing Sports Events, Agent Operations, Marketing, Operations, Infrastructure, Branding Public Relations, Fan Engagement, Sports Psychology, Sports Tourism, and Sports Technology.

Relatively untapped Career Options Relatively common Career Options • Commentators & Sports Experts • Coaching • Sports Technology Expert • Refering/Umpiring • Sports Media (Journalism, Writers, etc.) • Scoring • Sports Nutritionist • Data Analytics • Sports Lawyer. • MBA in Operations (Sports) Concerns directly affecting the youth engagement in choosing Sports as a Career: How many organizations are interested in hiring people other than sports personalities? Are Sports organizations keeping their doors open for the youth to enter? Are the organizations more comfortable with players only? Can non- sports persons be successful in this domain? Harsha Bhogle apart, no other non- sportsperson has made it big as a cricket commentator in India, for instance. How critical is a strong connect in the industry? What if a youngster has potential but no connect in the industry? Who will support him / her? Whom should he/she approach? The situation calls for immediate attention of the Government, Federations and Private players. This will boost engagement in the Sports industry rapidly 18 SPORTS DEVELOPMENT AND YOUTH ENGAGEMENT BUSINESS IN SPORTS SPORTS DEVELOPMENT AND YOUTH ENGAGEMENT 19 BUSINESS IN SPORTS Indian sports are undergoing a facelift. India has been identified as one of the biggest markets for sports. The country recently hosted the FIFA Under-17 World Cup and will be hosting the next edition of the Hockey World Cup.

SPORTS DEVELOPMENT AND YOUTH ENGAGEMENT 23 Improving governance and infrastructure The government has taken some major initiatives in this aspect, such as the ‘Khelo India’ Scheme, which focusses on developing sports infrastructure in rural as well as urban areas, encouraging a sporting culture through competitions, and identifying and nurturing young talent.

Sportspersons run the risk of sustaining injuries – minor as well as major. Being merely physically fit does not help if one does not know how to encounter challenges and fight back. Broad categories •Person’s condition with regard to their psychological Mental Health and emotional well-being. The better their mental health, the better will be their performance. Social Health •The ability to bond with individuals & the environment Emotional Health •Expressing one's emotions appropriately. Spiritual Health •It is a belief in a unifying force. This varies from person to person & has the concept of faith at its core. 26 SPORTS DEVELOPMENT AND YOUTH ENGAGEMENT Activities and Current state: Some facts and Figures The majority of the youth spend at least 1-2 hours daily doing physical activity, while 27 % spend less than an hour. The rest spend more than 2 hours on an average. Time spent on Physical Activities 100.00% 90.00% 80.00% 70.00% 60.00% 53.90% 50.00% 40.00% 30.00% 26.50% 20.00% 14.30% 10.00% 5.30% 0.00% Less than an hour 1-2 hour 2-3 hour more than 3 hour Less than an hour 1-2 hour 2-3 hour more than 3 hour Type of Activities People (in %) Gym 40.4% Running & Exercising 80.4% Yoga 17.6% Swimming 1.2% Other Activities 15.2% Youth are somewhat health conscious and engaged to some or the other activities to keep themselves fit.

It also helps in maintaining and improving health. A proper diet is the key to having a long and fulfilling career in sports. Sports and general well-being efforts In 2002, the World Health Organization made ‘Physical Activity’ the theme for World Health Day. Since then, April sixth is celebrated as the World Day for Physical Activity. The concept caught on worldwide. India took a step further in this regard. The UN was convinced to observe 21 June as Yoga Day. This initiative showcases our heritage and it also takes its practitioners closer to a healthier lifestyle. The popularity of Yoga is growing, not only in India, but also across the world. Physical Health Physical health is critical for sportspersons. Health, as they say, is wealth. Physical Liquor, Sustenance Medicinal Sleep and Action smoking and and eating self-care Rest medications routine 28 SPORTS DEVELOPMENT AND YOUTH ENGAGEMENT Mental Health Mental health is another key aspect. A sports person goes through several phases. He / she has to deal with praise, criticism and injuries. Many an outstanding talent has fallen by the wayside, simply because the individual could not handle the pressures that are an occupational hazard in sports. It is important that the sportspersons are helped to be as mentally robust as they are physically fit. Sporting Injury This is one of the key area 1) Over-training Lack of adequate recovery time coupled with the high intensity of training is the most obvious reason for over-training. 2) Overuse Redundant strain wounds are caused by repeated activities which apply weight to a specific gathering of muscles, joint or area of delicate tissue. As a rule, they decline after some time and incorporate wounds, for ex- ample, tennis elbow, golfer’s knee, hurler’s shoulder and jumper’s knee. 3) Improper Warm-up Inability to play out a legitimate warm-up can put you in danger for dam- age as the muscles and joints are not set up for exercise. A warm-up is important to build body temperature and course of blood to the muscles. A 15-20-minute warm-up ought to incorporate a mix of extending and car- diovascular activities to set up the body for exercise, expands execution levels and avoids wounds. 4) Poor technique Any activity or sports which is performed boringly with inappropriate technique is a formula for damage. After some time, the side effects of wounds being caused by the inappro- priate system will be aggravated and can either prompt a more genuine condition or result in more intense wounds. The most ideal approach to keep away from over and again playing out an activity/sports with the mis- taken procedure is to ensure youth to utilize an expert mentor or coach to demonstrate the right method to get things done from the earliest start- ing point and to guarantee they wear suitable dress, shoes and utilize the correct gear. 5) Workload Number of playing days have been tremendously increased as compared to the past few years across games. This is because of the number of leagues being introduced where the players play for a long duration of time and with less amount of rest is provided to them. Also, the hectic schedule of matches is another reason for the work overload. These days many players tend to suffer injuries due to workload. SPORTS DEVELOPMENT AND YOUTH ENGAGEMENT 29 Sports Injury Suffering Sports Doctor Support in Need 39% 19% Suffered from Sports Injury Never sufferred/ 81% don't play 61% Got advice from Sports Doctor/ Injury specialist No Sports Doctor Available- Advice from physician 61% of youth suffer from sports injuries 81% of youth who suffer from sports injuries do not get the right advice from Sports Doctor / physician, in need – this eventually leads to their disengagement from sports. There are times when physical injuries affect the sportsperson mentally. While some injuries can be managed easily with minimal disruption in sports participation, others are harder to overcome. A sportsperson’s mental health can come under strain if he / she is forced to take a hiatus from the game because of injury. The psychological response to injuries can trigger serious mental health issues. Depression Disengagement Anxiety Sleep Irritation Disturbance Lack of Disorder Eating Motivation 30 SPORTS DEVELOPMENT AND YOUTH ENGAGEMENT Mental Health Issue Remedial activity 35% 45% Conduct Suffer Mental Remedial Health Issue Activity No such Don't conduct problem any remedial 55% 65% 55% of youth have suffered from mental health issues apart from the physical issues 45%+ don’t follow any activity which can help them in stressful times. SPORTS DEVELOPMENT AND YOUTH ENGAGEMENT 31 32 SPORTS DEVELOPMENT AND YOUTH ENGAGEMENT CONCLUSION: THE WAY FORWARD SPORTS DEVELOPMENT AND YOUTH ENGAGEMENT 33 CONCLUSION: THE WAY FORWARD Building a culture of sports: Key in Youth Development Mindsets need to be changed. Parents need to be encouraged to support sports-oriented children. This will be the first step towards the evolution of a sporting culture in a country like India, where the family is the premier institution. Key initiatives the government can take Introduce sports in school/university curricula: Currently, most of the schools, colleges and universities focus only on the academic development of children. The government can mandate these academic institutions to introduce physical education and participation in sports as a part of the curricula to provide every student with an exposure to sports. Sports could be treated on par with academics by introducing it as a subject with equal weightage in examinations. Initiatives have already been taken with bodies like Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), state boards and All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE). Government needs to ensure effective implementation of the framework and policy. 34 SPORTS DEVELOPMENT AND YOUTH ENGAGEMENT Partner with foreign counterparts: The Indian government can partner with foreign governments to enable transfer of knowledge, which is mutually helpful. Special programs can be arranged to introduce Indian sportspersons to world-class training in sports in which we have the potential to excel but are lacking in terms of exposure. For example, India is referred to as the ’sleeping giant’ of football; the country’s budding footballers could gain a lot from an inclusive long-term development program. Key initiatives which the private for-profit and non-profit entities can undertake Setting up leagues: The IPL has had a cascading effect. In the past two to three years, India has observed a surge in the number of leagues in different sports, including football, kabaddi, wrestling, badminton, table tennis and hockey. More league-based tournaments for other sports in which we have the talent to do well (for example, archery, boxing and shooting) will only encourage more people to look at sports as a viable career option. Organize more inter-school tournaments to identify talent: :Several corporates, non-profit organizations and professional leagues in the country are involved in tapping young sporting talent through small-scale tournaments and training programmes. However, these programmes are not accessible to the majority, at the moment. More tournaments need to be organized in the interiors and rural areas as well, where a lot of talent is waiting to be identified. Provide ‘soft infrastructure’: In accumulation to the physical infrastructure, sportspersons also need ‘soft infrastructure’ for their growth; non-profit organizations can go a long way in mentoring talented sportspersons through mentorship programs. They can also help in terms of training the coaches. SPORTS DEVELOPMENT AND YOUTH ENGAGEMENT 35 For India to shine on the international sporting map, there is no other better option than focusing on youth engagement. The right support at the right time is the need of the hour. Lack of support: Loss of Youth Engagement in Sports 100% 90% 85% 80% 70% 60% 50% 40% 30% 20% 15% 10% 0% Lacked support: Could have joined Sports industry Got proper support Lacked support: Could have joined Sports industry Got proper support The Sports industry in India is losing almost 85% youth from the interested and talented pool (out of the interested 62%) More opportunities, professional and scientific training and coaching techniques and a sound support structure are needed. It is time to revamp policies and strategies – the Government has to join forces with the private sector. This will take India closer to becoming a sporting superpower. 36 SPORTS DEVELOPMENT AND YOUTH ENGAGEMENT ANNEXURE SPORTS DEVELOPMENT AND YOUTH ENGAGEMENT 37 ANNEXURE Methodology Considering the psychology while opting answers in primary research, we have taken 95% confidence level with 2% margin of error against India’s population.

I was amazed at myself how I could see the couple of inches gap from such a height. P.S. I've played a good level of cricket.

That man was not going to be stopped today.\",35,2025-06-01T20:42:25Z,83\nRaken_dep,\"Santner was containing the run rate in his overs Shreyas Iyer was taking all the pacers to the cleaners by utilising whatever pace they were offering to his advantage It was literal writing on the wall there for Hardik to use the strength of Santner (containing the RR) while also taking away the strength (the momentum Iyer had gathered against pace) of Shreyas Iyer today by utilising at least one more over of Santner if not both. Granted Shreyas is a good player of spin, but Santner bowls really tight and Iyer would really have to earn those runs against Mitch. Momentum is a thing in sports. It was Santner that brought the turning point of our season by taking the wicket of Karun, who, like Iyer, looked as though he was going to take Delhi towards the win. If Santner had given away even 12 runs per over, it would still have made a massive difference and put a lot of pressure on PBKS in the death overs. And the final nail in the coffin was Hardik not stepping up for the 19th over himself but instead handing the ball to a highly inexperienced and young player in a game like this. The MI management really shot themselves in the foot with this whole Hardik captaincy call. Even Hardik did himself a disservice by not choosing to continue with GT where he was doing well both as a captain and as a player.\",22,2025-06-01T22:52:49Z,84\nunnervinglynervous,Not bowling Santner and bowling Ashwani at a very stressful moment is a decision I will continue to be baffled by.

Why was he batting like we've already gotten enough? Maybe I'm being reactionary but fuck this man, this was a game we should've won.\",27,2025-06-01T20:32:40Z,152\nOptimumWaste,Agreed with all of the points. Hardik is very cocky and over confident. Played like we had already won the match. Didn't even realise the ball was holding up and they had to bowl short and slow. He fucks it up again. Ashwani has no experience but he just kept feeding Iyer. Absolutely shocking from the whole MI team. Malinga and pollard should be shown the door lol wtf are they even there for. I mean I have never played even school cricket but I could see the ball was holding up. But all these stalwarts were just high on coke or something. I just hope Hardik is taken off captaincy now and vadapav shown the door.,16,2025-06-01T20:41:37Z,153\nartapretor,I knew it when they got baited by reece while having Ashwini.,11,2025-06-01T20:26:54Z,154\nvarunpigeon55,\"I think today’s game was lost due to Hardik’s captaincy. So many blunders in the second innings. - Not using Santner when he was clearly the bowler who was containing the opposition. More so when PBSK for scoring freely against pace bowling. - Setting up the game to bowl the last over - Glory Hunter. Hardik was clearly one of the better bowlers. He should have bowled the 17th or 19th over. I guess he wanted the glory if MI did end up containing PBSK. I am not saying this because Mumbai lost or trying to hate on Hardik, but it’s clearly a pattern with his game. He doesn’t read the game in critical moments and always has to depend on individual brilliance from someone to rescue him out. I’m sure he will improve but it is important to step back and put the team forward.\",10,2025-06-01T23:33:26Z,155\nOptimumWaste,\"Not only is he short on ideas but also unjustifiably cocky and over-confident. He was batting like there was no urgency. Scored 14 off 15 I think and all the pressure shifted on Dheer, who was fantastic. He should always play ahead of Pandya. While bowling, the decisons he took were stupid as fuck. All the bowlers, including Bumrah kept bowling full and no change of pace when the pitch was clearly holding up if you bowl short. PBKS used it brilliantly and restricted MI to 200. Never backed himself as a bowler, even though he was bowling well or Santner, who was criminally under-bowled throughout the IPL. It also seems he doesn't command respect or communication from other players.\",2,2025-06-02T10:19:00Z,156\nComplex-Success-604,\"MI players might sleep today, but ashwini will definitely not sleep today, tomorrow and day after tomorrow\",7,2025-06-01T20:30:14Z,157\nvincrypt112,\"Naah man, it was over no matter what..24 off 12 on that deck shreyas was gonna chase in his sleep..naman dheer misjudgment and boulty drop coat big time…nehal took pressure off completly and for whatever reason hardik thought nehal can bash santner left and right\",8,2025-06-01T20:56:01Z,158\nViagraGod56,Well Fucking Played Iyer🙇🏻 that yorker to four was goated stuff.,8,2025-06-01T20:34:27Z,159\nThe_Flash_20,\"MI:- No one has chased 200 vs. us ever Le PBKS This is the year of records breaking Spurs, PSG and now 1 of the RCB or PBKS finally winning a trophy\",26,2025-06-01T20:19:16Z,160\norganised-choas,\"Serious blunders by Hardik at multiple points in the match : - Santer should have bowled atleast 3 if not 4 overs. He's a top quality international spinner, and if he's not bowling his full quota, that's criminal. Chahal bowled his full quota of 4 overs; and Santer didn't after giving away just 15 runs in 2 overs. Shame! - Hardik himself should have bowled more. Putting the onus on Topley and Ashwani just shows the lack of character and leadership of Hardik. Shame! - Rohit could trust Hardik with the 2 off the last 4 overs in a T20 World Cup Final, but Hardik couldn't trust himself. Shame! - Serves the MI management right for sticking with Hardik as captain after last year's debacle. After this year, there should be no more doubt that Hardik is not captaincy material. Making players like Rohit, Sky and Bumrah play under a jerk like Hardik. Shame! - Now I'm fully backing PBKS and Shreyas to lift the title. ICT needs Shreyas at the helm atleast in white ball cricket. I'm hoping that winning back to back IPL titles will finally give Shreyas his due and get him the long-deserved white-ball captaincy. - Have been a lifelong MI fan. But I'm no more supporting MI until Hardik is removed as captain. If Ro is in the team, he's gotta be the captain. If not Ro, then SKY.
